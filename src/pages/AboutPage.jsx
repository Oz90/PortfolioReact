        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Özgür Baserdem and I'm currently an aspiring full stack web
          developer. Before I began the journey of learning how to code I
          studied political science at Stockholms Unversity and worked within
          the public sector in Sweden which has been an amazing experience where
          I met lots of amazing people and learned a lot. However, during my
          paternal leave I had the time to reflect and think about where I
          really wanted to make a career. Basically I had two options: stay
          within my current field and make a career where I am "safe" and not
          really evolve professionally in a way I want or change career into
          something I find exciting, fun and challenging. I've chosen the latter
          because I believe that it will make me happier to do something I find
          meaningful and where I feel like I'm evolving professionally in a
          direction I want. Therefore I've taken my first serious steps into the
          world of web development by applying to Nackademin's Full Stack Web
          Development programme which spans over 2 years where I'll learn
          programming both in theory and in practice. But probably most
          important of all I'll get the chance to learn programming at a real
          workplace during my internship, which I am looking forward too!

        <p>
          So currently, I am still taking my first steps of becoming a Full
          Stack Web Developer and I'm doing it at Nackademin. Nackademin is a
          higher vocational education school in Stockholm, Sweden. Nackademin
          was founded back in 1994 by two teachers who had an idea of starting
          an education that had a close collaboration and relation to the
          companies and industries it was educating students for. They thought
          that this would benefit the companies as well as the students and I
          personally believe in this strongly and it is also the reason why I
          chose to study at Nackademin because I think that Nackademins long
          experience and their ties to the IT-industry is very valuable when
          it's time for me to do my internship.

        <h2>Full Stack Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          At Nackademin I am currently in the Full Stack Open Source Web
          Developer programme which I chose because I wanted to learn both the
          front-end and back-end parts of web development. I believe that this
          gives me an edge in my career as I'll be able to understand large
          parts of the development process and hopefully be able to adjust
          accordingly depending on what is needed in the teams I work. I'll
          things like NodeJS, PHP, JavaScript, React, HMTL, CSS and SQL. This
          basically means that I'll have knowledge in how to program a browser
          (JavaScript), program a server (NodeJS) and program a database (SQL).
          I hope that my broad range of qualities will give me a great
          understanding of the different parts of web development as well as
          give me the possibility to help other team members, as well as
          understand them better. I am very much looking forward to putting my
          skills to work during my first internship starting in the fall of
          2021.
